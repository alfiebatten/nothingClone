# Nothing Clone

This is the README.md file. Please find below details and all relevant information on the project. 

## The Aim 

The aim of the project was to create a replica site based off of an instagram video (https://www.instagram.com/p/C_bm3TwOktB/). The video showcases a range of transtions and scroll events to animate between the website sections. 

The following guidelines need to be met: 
- Identify and replicate all key animations (e.g., hover effects, scrolling animations, transitions)
- Ensure the animations closely match the timing, easing, and visual style of the original website
- Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or TypeScript) for this task. Or choose something else and explain why it is better in your submission
- Ensure the site is mobile responsive 
- Ensure the animations are smooth and dont lag as well as avoiding performance bottlenecks 
- Write clean, well-documented code 
- Submit the code through a GitHub repository 
- Have the site hosted so a live demo can be viewed
