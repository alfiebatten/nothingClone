# Nothing Clone

This is the README.md file. Please find below details and all relevant information on the project. 

A live demo of the website can be found here (https://nothingcloneproject.netlify.app/)

## The Aim 

The aim of the project was to create a replica site based off of an instagram video (https://www.instagram.com/p/C_bm3TwOktB/). The video showcases a range of transtions and scroll events to animate between the website sections. 

The following guidelines need to be met: 
- Identify and replicate all key animations (e.g., hover effects, scrolling animations, transitions)
- Ensure the animations closely match the timing, easing, and visual style of the original website
- Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or TypeScript) for this task. Or choose something else and explain why it is better in your submission
- Ensure the site is mobile responsive 
- Ensure the animations are smooth and dont lag as well as avoiding performance bottlenecks 
- Write clean, well-documented code 
- Submit the code through a GitHub repository 
- Have the site hosted so a live demo can be viewed

## Differentiations From The Demo Video  
- The live demo is not a perfect replica of the demo video, instead it intends to showcase the transitions and scroll events being utilised. 
- Some features were added to the live demo to increase the overall feel and functionlity of the site, such as a custom cursor, scroll indicator, hover events and text animations.

## Current Bugs 
- Safari and Mobile caching issue causing earbud image on page load to appear masked as a rectangle 
- Safari rendering issue where sections briefly appear upon scrolling to top of page
